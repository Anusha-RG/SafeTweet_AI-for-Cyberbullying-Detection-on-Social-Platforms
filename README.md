# SafeTweet: AI for Cyberbullying Detection on Social Platforms  

## üìå Overview  
Cyberbullying is a major issue on social media platforms, with harmful effects on mental health and well-being. This project, **SafeTweet**, explores Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to detect cyberbullying in tweets.  

The project implements and compares multiple models:  
- **Naive Bayes (NB)**  
- **Logistic Regression (LR)** (baseline and tuned)  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) with PCA**  
- **DistilBERT (transformer-based model)**  

We evaluate these models using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy, with **DistilBERT achieving the best results (87.7% accuracy)** before resource limitations.

## üìä Dataset  
- **Source:** [Kaggle ‚Äì Cyberbullying Classification](https://www.kaggle.com)  
- **Size:** 47,692 tweets  
- **Classes:** 6 (e.g., age, ethnicity, gender, religion, other, not-cyberbullying)  
- **Binary conversion:** Converted to `cyberbullying` vs `not cyberbullying`  

**Preprocessing steps:**  
- Text cleaning (URLs, mentions, special characters)  
- Tokenization & lemmatization  
- Removal of duplicates  
- Oversampling for class balance
